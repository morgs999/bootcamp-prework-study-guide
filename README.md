# BootcampPreworkStudyGuide

## Description
This project was built as a repository to both practice my lessons from the boot camp, and also to provide a place to copy down notes and shorthand for anything encountered during the boot camp.

As opposed to keeping my notes and practices on a local computer, or a random note app or word processor, my materials are now easily accessible in the environments I'm using within the Boot Camp, such as GitHub and VSCode.

They also provide a visual representation for any other students who would like to share my notes in the future.
